# simple react-template

A use as-is base template for univeral use. (Is that redundant?)

Includes node packages (work with most Node versions up to 8.1.4) 

To build "$npm install"

To run "gulp"

This will use browserfy to build working version the "dist" folder. All source java script and css is, of course, under "src"

An added little feature is the use of sass to create the css, so be sure to install sass and compass if you really blow it up. If not you just add whatever css framework you like (bootstrap, foundation, whatever.. )

Comes complete with one simple component and a basic flux framework (though no flux components are included (stores, events, constants, etc...)).

I also included an API utility in the utils folder that uses the axios node module to make rest calls, but only for those that already know what they're doing. Its not particularly well documents. 

Enjoy!!
